# Bank ðŸ’°

**This project is part of the object-oriented deepening of the JS language, and is a prerequisite for starting training in frameworks and many of the other parts that make up the world of front-end and back-end programming.**

**In it, we built the first part of a banking system, with balance, customer registration, etc... And now, we will basically improve this system, putting into hand types of accounts (savings and checking accounts), in addition to that we'll solve code problems, based on objects, classes, and node.js itself as a test base...**

- **Deepen your knowledge in Object Orientation**
- **Learn what the "DuckType" is**
- **Understand when and how to use inheritance within your projects**
- **Learn about good programming practices**
